{"id":"e473f32fc0a5df963c1d60ccc66c8989","document":"Set wholly in a secondary school in a working-class district of Paris, where many inhabitants are foreign-born, the film follows the year of a young teacher, Francois Marin, and the 25 pupils aged 14 or 15 who he takes for an hour each day in French language. A loner, he walks the narrow line between maintaining discipline and gaining co-operation. From the start, wide differences are apparent in the class over standards of dress, deportment, knowledge and application.||||| A dispute arises over using the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive, which he admits may be a bit of an affectation and is then labelled as gay. When pupils have to read aloud from a set book, The Diary of Anne Frank, a girl called Khoumba refuses because she does not consider it relevant to her life. In private, Francois forces her to apologise. Success comes when he asks the pupils to write a self-portrait. An assertive girl called Esmeralda reveals that she would like to be a policewoman or failing that, a rapper. A difficult boy called Souleymane, weak in written French, submits his story in an interesting series of photographs (at a parents' evening, his mother can speak no French at all). However, after an argument over football teams with Carl, another boy who is problematic, Souleymane insults Francois and is sent to the head teacher's office.||||| At a teachers' conference to decide final placings, Francois defends Souleymane but his efforts are undermined by the two student representatives at the meeting, Esmeralda and Louise, who behave in a very childish manner. Afterwards, though sworn to secrecy, the two girls tell the others that Francois had it in for Souleymane. A furious Francois rebukes the pair, saying they behaved like \"skanks\" (French: petasses). Uproar follows, in which Souleymane, after accidentally hitting Khoumba with his sports bag, storms out and is suspended.||||| After a disciplinary hearing at which Souleymane is supported by his mother, for whom he has to translate, he is expelled and faces possible deportation to his native country, Mali. In the last lesson of the year, Francois asks each pupil what they have learned over the year. Carl has been inspired by science experiments in his chemistry class, Khoumba has warmed to music and enjoyed learning Spanish, Esmerelda pretends to have learned nothing but then admits that she has been reading Plato's Republic and is gripped by the character of Socrates. After they have all left the room, a quiet girl called Henriette comes back and despondently claims that she really has not learned anything at all. Outside, an impromptu football match has begun between the pupils and teachers.","summary":"Teacher Francois Marin and his colleagues are preparing for another school year teaching at a racially mixed inner city high school in Paris. The teachers talk to each other about their prospective students, both the good and the bad. The teachers collectively want to inspire their students, but each teacher is an individual who will do things in his or her own way to achieve the results they desire. They also have differing viewpoints on the students themselves, and how best to praise and discipline them. The administration of the school tries to be as fair as possible, which includes having student representatives sit on the student evaluation committee. Marin's class this year of fourteen and fifteen year olds is no different than previous years, although the names and faces have changed. Marin tries to get through to his students, sometimes with success and sometimes resulting in utter failure. Even Marin has his breaking point, which may result in him doing things he would probably admit to himself are wrong. But after all is said and done, there is next year and another group of students."}

Larry has been down on his luck for so long, he forgets what happiness feels like. On the desolate streets of industrial Philadelphia, he peddles satellite TV packages to pay the bills. Larry fantasizes about seeing the world, but he stopped believing it was possible back when he still had a full head of hair and weighed under 200.

{"id":"97050b204c9aee0835d73b60ee0253f9","document":"Aang tries to mediate the tension between Katara and Sokka by telling them that action will solve their problems instead of harsh words. Katara and Sokka are arguing over how to set up their campsite, with Aang ending the fight and gloating about his ability to solve problems as the Avatar . Soon after, they travel to the Great Divide , the largest canyon in the entire world . While Katara expresses awe at seeing the yawning chasm before them, Sokka is bored by the sight, viewing it as somewhat lackluster, and expresses his intent to fly over it on Appa . Before they can leave, however, a man runs up to them and warns them not to leave with a guide to cross the canyon because he was there first.||||| The man angrily says to the team that he is holding a spot for the rest of his tribe, the Gan Jin , until they arrive. While waiting, the Zhang tribe arrives, whom the man claims has been an enemy of his tribe for a hundred years. The two tribes' differences are immediately visible: while the Gan Jin tribe appears neat, well-mannered, and clean, dressed in clothes of white fabric, the Zhang tribe seems dirty and primitive, dressed in garments made from animal skins.||||| The earthbending canyon guide subsequently arrives, prompting both tribes to begin arguing over which should be escorted first: the Zhangs claim that some of their members are sick, while the Gan Jins assert that their elderly are weary from their travel. As the two tribes bicker, Katara wonders if Aang is ready to test his role as a mediator. Despite Aang's reservations about his possible success, Katara alerts the tribes of Aang's status as the Avatar, giving him the chance to propose that they all travel together. When the tribes dismiss the suggestion and resume their argument, Aang ends the verbal fight by shouting over the chaos that Appa will carry their sick and elderly while the two tribes cross the canyon together, conditions to which both tribes agree.||||| The canyon guide is rendered unable to earthbend after a canyon crawler broke both his arms. The canyon guide warns them not to take any food into the canyon, as food attracts dangerous predators in the canyon. The two tribes, the gang, and the guide begin their descent to the canyon floor. After the guide breaks a rock shelf so that potential Fire Nation soldiers cannot follow them, a canyon crawler assaults them. Aang and his friends fend it off, but not before it attacks the guide, breaking both of his arms and rendering him unable to earthbend. With no other earthbenders in either of the groups, Aang realizes that they are now imprisoned in the canyon. Both tribes begin to argue again and finally decide to split up. As the tribes each blame the other for the attack, Aang furiously orders them to separate and travel in two separate groups. As they divide, Aang, curious as to why the two factions hold such animosity toward each other, asks Katara and Sokka to accompany the Gan Jins and the Zhangs, respectively, and try to discover the reason for their feud.||||| That night, both sides, unaware of the conversation of the other group, discuss the use of tarps; while the Zhangs feel it unnecessary to use them as rain protection during the dry season, the Gan Jins dutifully hang the tarps over their tents anyway, reasoning you could never be too careful. Their respective opinions cause Katara and Sokka to sympathize with the groups they are accompanying. Also around the same time, both tribes reveal that they brought food into the canyon against the orders of the guide, justifying their actions by stating that they should not go hungry while the other tribe, which they both believe to have brought food with them, eats. Both tribes soon tell their guests their version of the story behind their feud.||||| According to the Gan Jins , Jin Wei was ambushed and robbed by Wei Jin , a Zhang . The Gan Jins tell Katara of their tribal forefather, an earthbender named Jin Wei , who was tasked with the job of taking the sacred crystal orb from a gate in the east to a gate in the west as part of a redemption ritual. They claim that, as he neared the western gate, Jin Wei was assaulted by a thief, a Zhang named Wei Jin , who stole the orb out of greed. The Zhangs, on the other hand, tell Sokka that their ancestor, Wei Jin, found Jin Wei passed out on the ground near the western gate. Wei Jin stopped to help the man and was told about the redemption ritual and the orb's importance. Rejecting assistance, Jin Wei asked Wei Jin to take the orb back to his tribe, which Wei Jin did. Upon arriving at the Gan Jin's village, however, Jin Wei's tribe arrested him for stealing the orb and imprisoned him for twenty years. Both sides claim that they will never forget the terrible injustice dealt to them by the other.||||| Aang spends the night with Momo and the guide, away from the tribes. When Aang sadly states that getting the two factions to cooperate is virtually impossible and that the most important issue before them is escaping the canyon, the guide wonders if the two problems are connected. Cornered by canyon crawlers , the Gan Jins and Zhangs work together to save everyone. The next day, the two tribes reunite and reach the end of the canyon. When Aang asks Katara and Sokka if the tribes might work together at all, the siblings begin to argue, both siding with their assigned tribe. The tribes themselves also begin arguing again and when Aang tries to pacify them with his belief that \"harsh words won't solve problems, action will\".||||| Realizing that the Avatar may be right, the tribal leaders prepare to fight to the death in order to end the feud. Aang, angry, uses airbending to separate them; as the people tumble backward, the food they carried with them is discovered. Not believing what he is seeing, Aang scolds the tribes for disobeying the canyon guide's warning not to bring food, but is quickly distracted by an egg custard tart since he has not eaten in a day. As he speaks, a horde of canyon crawlers, attracted to the abundance of food, approach the refugees. After an initial skirmish with the beasts, Aang realizes that the crawlers want the food more than they want to attack the tribes and convinces the tribes to cooperate; by working together and throwing bags over the crawlers' heads, everyone is able to mount the beasts and, guiding them with food, ride them up the wall and out of the canyon.||||| The Gan Jin and the Zhang tribes resolve their dispute thanks to Aang 's lie. Safe and out of danger, the two tribes compliment each other's ability to take on the crawlers but subsequently pick up their feud right where they left off and are on the verge of a physical altercation when Aang, upon hearing the names of the two tribes' ancestors for the first time, suddenly pipes up that he knew the two men personally long ago. He begins to tell everyone that he had met them a hundred years prior, though notes that a lot of confusion rose in regards to the details of the story. The men had not been enemies, but eight-year-old twin brothers, who played a game called \"Redemption\", clarifying that the sacred orb was just a regular ball they played with and the gates the respective goals.||||| As Jin Wei was running with the ball, he fell, fumbling the ball in the process; Wei Jin recovered it and started running to the other end of the field, though stepped out of bounds and was put in the penalty box for two minutes, not twenty years. He concludes his story by pointing out that while Wei Jin was \"kind of a slob\" and Jin Wei was \"a little stuffy\", they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field. Convinced by Aang's tale, the tribes make amends and continue their journey to Ba Sing Se , the Earth Kingdom capital, as one tribe, followed by the guide, who expresses his intention to never again return to the Great Divide. As the tribes depart, Sokka tells Aang how convenient it was that he knew the twins. To Katara and Sokka's shock, however, Aang reveals that the story was a complete fabrication. Still hungry, he asks where the egg custard tart is, as they make their way to Appa in order to continue their journey.","summary":"While on their way to the North Pole, Aang and his friends arrive at a giant canyon where two groups of refugees are bickering over who should get to go across. Aang decides to walk across with the two groups to ensure they don't fight one another. However, he soon learns that the two tribes have been feuding for one hundred years and they both believe their actions are justified. But when the predators inside the canyon start to come out, Aang is stuck trying to defend both tribes from each other and the vicious wildlife."}

The detective (Clark Johnson) reacts with disgust and asks Quinn whether people in his line of work ever do anything but make things worse. Saul returns to Langley where he's been largely absent despite being acting director. Dar Adal and Senator Lockhart (Tracy Letts) are both there waiting for him and looking for answers.||||| Saul apprises them of the entire operation--the blackmailing of Javadi into cooperating, how it was done, and who was involved. When Lockhart learns that Javadi is still in the country, he demands that his departing plane be grounded so that Javadi can be tried immediately rather than used as an asset. When Saul refuses, Lockhart demands a phone where he can call the President. Pretending to comply, Saul leads him into a conference room and locks him inside until Javadi's plane has left U.S. airspace.||||| Afterwards, Saul and Dar Adal share a drink; Adal congratulates Saul on his successful operation. Carrie escorts Javadi to a plane to go back to Iran, keeping up the guise in front of his entourage that Carrie is the one whose hand is being forced by Javadi. Before he boards, Javadi volunteers some information to Carrie: the man who built the bomb and moved Brody's car into place at Langley is still at large in the U.S., and that Leland Bennett, Javadi's lawyer, should know his identity. Carrie goes back to Quinn asking for his help in clearing Brody's name. Quinn seemingly agrees to help, but confesses to Carrie his total disillusionment with the CIA and his doubts that any of their actions can be ultimately justifiable.","summary":"Following him murdering his ex-wife and ex-daughter-in-law, Majid Javadi is being held at the safe house, with Saul his main interrogator.

Saul, Carrie and Quinn have to decide how best to control the situation. Because he has been missing from his desk for some time working on this covert operation, Saul knows that he has to come clean to both Senator Lockhart, who is visiting Langley, and Dar Adal, especially as Adal is aware of the surveillance footage.
