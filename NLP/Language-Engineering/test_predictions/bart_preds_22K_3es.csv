3,"Society tells us that beautiful women have it all. But beauty can be as much a curse as it is a blessing. Being beautiful doesn't equate to happiness; ""Being beautiful is overrated"", says the filmmaker. In the film eight women labeled as beautiful consider body image issues through their candid stories of how concepts and realities of physical beauty have shaped their lives in both good ways and bad. Objectification, negative stereotyping, jealousy, insecurity, and vulnerability are prominent themes, as are opportunity and preferential treatment. Kravinsky states: ""Beauty making things easier for a woman is a double edged sword."" The film looks at how being beautiful affects relationships and self-esteem as well as career. It may be easier for a beautiful woman to find a date or a job, but the film seeks to show that having things come easier creates jealousy and laziness and does not encourage development of the inner beauty that a woman needs as she grows older and her beauty fades. Kravinsky compares beauty to sugar: it is very sweet, but too much of it can be a killer.","The film looks at how beauty affects relationships and self-esteem as well as career.

Fully prepared, the team up their game, but whilst their attention is focussed on the marks, they forget just how devious JW3 is. He's sure to double cross them; it's not a matter of if, but when. After all, the greatest con of all is to con another grifter.","A new grifter is in town and he's in search of a great crew. He turns out to be the grandson of the legendary 19th Century American con artist James Whittaker Wright, who made a fortune flogging fake gold mines on the stock market by using Cornfoots Merchant Bank. When JW3's fortune became too much for the bank, they turned on him and left him to die penniless. Now, the Hustle crew must come up with a plan to bring down a greedy bank and outwitting a fellow grifter.","Our favorite hustlers are approached by someone calling himself James Whittaker Wright III. A grifter himself, he proposes a stock scam involving the City bank that swindled his grandfather many years before. The deal sounds good but Albert and the rest are pretty sure that JW 3, as he calls himself, is out to scam them as well. Soon Stacie Monroe is working in the merchant bank, Danny is a loud-mouthed investor wanting to float shares in the market and Mickey is posing as a company doctor. As the scam proceeds, we learn exactly what happened to JW 3's grandfather. In the process of getting even, the hustlers seem to have forgotten one important thing."

317,"The network UniMas aired a combination of episodes from the February, Vina del Mar, on April 9th, 2019 under the title, Special 3. It was a 2 hour special with three performers: Marco Antonio Solis, Raphael, and Sebastion Yatra, in that order. They sang their biggest hits with Solis and Raphel getting 45 minutes each, and 30 minutes to Yatra. The first artist perhaps was filmed the best and went a little more smoothly than the rest.

The second artist did not fare as well with the camera.||||| Most of the time when Raphael went into his little dance moves, the camera instead focused on the audience. A big mistake. Sometimes, though, when he took a quick turn at conducting the orchestra, the camera was with him. All in all, though, despite his great voice(and he was in very good voice) and grand emotion, his performance was all but ruined. Sebastion Yatra, to close out the show, had less time and more dancers! He also had the biggest wardrobe change. The camera work was better with him than Raphael for shore. He never really danced, but certainly moved, and jumped around quite a lot. He also interacted with the audience more than the others. Certainly to see these three performers together in one show was a wonderful idea! To sum up, great songs, great performances, but the camera was not stationary enough. More attention to the performers was needed, less to the audience!","The network UniMas aired a combination of episodes from the February, Vina del Mar, on April 9th, 2019 under the title, Special 3.

493,"RESCUE will capture the dynamics and drama of disaster response, giving the audience an insiders view of a truly remarkable force for good in a world that is increasingly in need of it. From the individual civilian at risk for their life adrift at sea to a massive natural disaster threatening thousands of lives, there is a mechanism and resources in place to help save lives. Oddly, the instrument of hostility, the military, is even more often the instrument for saving civilian lives on both a smaller and larger scale.||||| Our story takes place in the U.S. and Canada, countries whose military are frequently called upon to support humanitarian crises. In the U.S., the USAF maintains and operates a large fleet of unusually equipped cargo aircraft, the C-17, originally designed to move troops and huge military assets to remote parts of the battlefield in support of combat troops. In fact, these unique airplanes and their crews fly far more humanitarian missions than military missions, carrying everything from Pararescue professionals and the helicopters or vehicles needed to rescue civilians from harms way to medical supplies, food, and even bulldozers to begin the job of rebuilding after disaster strikes. In Canada, ships originally designed for combat support missions are really vessels employed for peaceful means when called upon by domestic or foreign governments, often working with NGO's to provide relief for troubled nations in remote parts of the world. Disaster Response commands are in place to deploy appropriate resources to trouble spots at a moment's notice, often requiring split second decisions with many lives at stake.","RESCUE will capture the dynamics and drama of disaster response, giving the audience an insiders view of a truly remarkable force for good in a world that is increasingly in need of it.

When Grant's bodyguard, Barney Millen, is shot during a shake-down attempt, Blake defends him at trial, claiming he fixed an acid burn and not a gunshot wound. When Millen is acquitted of murder, Blake takes photos of the operation that documents what he's done.","Dr. Ralph Snyder and Dr. Frank Blake open an office together but soon split over a rivalry for nightclub singer Diana Wayne and a difference over ethics. In an effort to make some quick money and marry Diana, Blake becomes a retainer for gangster Joe Grant while the upright (and uptight) Sawyer becomes a medical examiner in the district attorney's office. Grant is involved in a murder and forces Blake to remove an identifying scar, thereby proving that all gangsters should keep a doctor on retainment. But Blake has a change of heart and shows up at Grant's trial, spills the beans and Grant is convicted. Consequently, Blake loses his license, Diana and then his life, proving that the ""do-tell' doctor should have heeded the film title."

But after ten weeks of whisking, crimping and piping, only one can emerge victorious.||||| This time, nobody is safe because Mary and Paul may decide to lose not one but two bakers at any time. The judges set the signature challenges as true home baker staples so that they can immediately see the bakers' personalities and their range of skills and ideas, setting them apart from each other. The first challenge is a sandwich cake. While this might seem simple, there is a difficult choice to be made between going for the classic or being experimental. Something tried and tested might not stand out, but going for ambitious flavours and ideas could miss the mark. Mary's first technical challenge is for angel food cake, which is not the bakers' idea of heaven as they attempt to follow the bare bones of the recipe, which proves to be a recipe for disaster for some. The showstopper explores all things chocolate, and is their final chance to secure their place in the Bake Off and save them from being the first to leave the tent.","The Bake Off returns and for the first time ever, the tent welcomes a baker's dozen to do battle.
