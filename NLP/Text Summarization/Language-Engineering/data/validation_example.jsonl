{"id":"1ec7843deddb3947133d9f96880bd198","document":"Flight attendant Montana Moore (Paula Patton) says that her mother Catherine (Jenifer Lewis) has always been big on marriage. Not surprising, since it's shown that she's been married many, many times. Unfortunately for Montana, her relationships have never worked out. She is practical about the kind of man she wants (he must be faithful, not care about work more than her, not have an attitude, and financially secure), but she mostly doesn't want to be alone. Recently, Montana's met the man who might be \"the one\" - Graham Jackson (Boris Kodjoe). She finds out from her friend and neighbor William (Derek Luke) that Graham wrote her a letter inviting her to spend Thanksgiving with him in Chicago. She also tells her fellow flight attendant friends, the promiscuous Gail (Jill Scott) and her gay BFF Sam (Adam Brody), excitedly thinking that this might be the weekend where Graham proposes to her. Before Montana leaves, Sam gives her a necklace from his grandmother to find true love while Gail gives her cranberry-flavored condoms.||||| Montana and Graham take a romantic boat ride to his place and later have sex. Instead of taking her back to his place, however, Graham leaves Montana at a hotel while he goes to prepare for a business meeting. Montana calls Gail to express her concern, which makes Gail suspicious that Graham is hiding another woman. Montana reluctantly (and clumsily) sneaks over to Graham's place and sees that he is indeed preparing for a business meeting, leading her to think that she has finally found the perfect guy to share her life with. That's when another woman enters into the room, and she is pregnant. Montana realizes that she was the mistress and she leaves sadly. William hears Montana playing the same sad song over and over, so he cheers her up by cooking her a meal.||||| Later, Montana visits her mom and sister Sheree (Lauren London) to find out that Sheree has just gotten engaged. Montana thinks it's too soon as Sheree is still just a college sophomore, but she insists that her fiancee is just perfect. She asks Montana to be the bridesmaid at the wedding, which causes her more distress. She expresses to Gail and Sam how she doesn't want to show up to her sister's wedding alone, especially since her mom will nag her about staying single. Montana decides she must find a husband within 30 days or risk showing up to that wedding alone. Sam comes up with the plan of just \"coincidentally\" bumping into one of her exes by meeting them on one of their flights across the country to see which one is right for her, and since he's done favors for several people who work for the same airline as them, they owe him and can fix Montana's work schedule to coincide with the flights of these men. Gail is against the idea as she knows it is illegal, and because she knows her best friend doesn't need a man to define her.||||| The first ex Sam checks on is Damon Diesel (Trey Songz), a rapper who is supposedly wealthy enough for Montana to go back to. Before she can make her decision, Catherine visits Montana to tell her that she has failed her daughter in finding her a man. Montana clearly doesn't wanna hear it and then goes back to Sam so he can give her Damon's flight time. She gets a ride to the airport from William, who is skeptical about her plans, but he wishes her luck. Montana \"bumps into\" Damon on his flight to Houston, and they seem to be hitting it off well. He takes her back to his place to get in the bathtub. Turns out the place really belongs to Damon's nutty co-worker Janine (Tia Mowry). It also turns out that Damon is broke and is mooching off of Janine. He tells Montana to leave through the fire escape as Janine breaks down the door and tries to attack Damon.||||| Gail tells Montana that Bachelor #2 is going to D.C. and Montana has an hour to catch the flight. She meets an ex named Langston (Taye Diggs) as well as another ex named Curtis (Tyler Lepley). Montana gets off the plane with Langston, who says he's running for Congress. That evening, Langston takes Montana to meet with potential campaign contributors, the Donaldsons (Ned and Sandra Beatty). On their date, Langston takes control of what happens, including ordering Montana's drink for her even when she tries to order something else. Although he secures funding from Mr. Donaldson, the man starts making suggestively condescending remarks about Langston representing his \"people\", and it gets more awkward when Montana gets in on the jabbing. Donaldson later doubles his contribution because her Tiger Woods joke made him laugh. Langston tells Montana that if she is gonna stick with him, she needs to stay seen and not heard. It's also obvious that Langston loves his dog Juicy more than anyone. Montana angrily leaves and takes the outfit he gave her, then calls William to drive out to Georgetown to pick her up.||||| William takes her back to his place to watch a movie and they have a drink while checking out their old high school yearbook. They dance to a song they listened to at their prom and then fool around for a bit before they kiss. However, this turns out to have just been a dream Montana had as she fell asleep on William's shoulder. Montana wakes up to find Catherine sitting next to her on the bed.||||| Montana gets fed up with her mom's constant butting into her life, so she lies and says she's got a date to Sheree's rehearsal dinner. She takes William to get fitted for outfits for the dinner. It starts getting more obvious that there's a connection going on between them. Montana then gets a text from Sam telling her to get to the airport. With 16 days left, Montana keeps meeting up with other exes, but they only continue to disappoint her and she continues to grow more frustrated. On another flight, Montana sees William's girlfriend Taylor (Christina Milian) with another man. Taylor asks Montana not to not tell William about it since she claims they just broke up. She then asks Montana for some tea, which pisses her off.||||| Montana calls William in the middle of the night to talk, but discovers that Taylor is there with him. She grabs the phone from William and hangs up on Montana. Montana then later gets drunk and sings karaoke at a bar, attracting the attention of an ex-boyfriend named Quentin (Djimon Hounsou). He treats her to a meal and reveals that he owns the hotel she's staying at. He makes it clear he's set on traveling and seeing the world instead of getting married, but he tells her that if she's looking for marriage, she should let it come to her. As a gift, he gives her a diamond bracelet, but she goes back home feeling defeated.||||| William visits Montana to express his feelings about her whole plan, but she rudely tells him off and tells him about Taylor, but he just leaves upset with her. The night of the rehearsal dinner comes, and Catherine brags that Montana has an announcement to make. Before Montana says anything, Langston shows up to propose. Catherine jumps to answer before Montana can, but she rejects him before everybody. She tells everyone how she's been going around looking for somebody to marry so everybody can accept her as an equal, but she realizes she doesn't need marriage to define her, and she's come to find herself along the way. She also tells Sheree that if she really loves her man, she supports her, but if it's for any reason other than love, it would be a mistake. Sheree and her fiance admit they rushed into the engagement because of her mother. They agree to wait until they graduate and get to know each other before marrying.||||| Outside, Catherine apologizes to Montana for pressuring her and her sister into marriage because she didn't want them to end up like her with multiple husbands. She admits that Montana's father was her first and only true love until his death. Catherine tells her to never let go of her true love when she finds him. They hug. While having food with Gail and Sam, Quentin comes to visit Montana. Gail tries to push her to see him, but Montana tells him that she wants more than expensive gifts and adventures, and she won't settle for anything less. Quentin agrees with her and she gives him back the bracelet.||||| Gail thinks she's crazy for letting him go and then spots a gift from William. Montana opens it to find a box of Cracker Jacks as a reminder of when he proposed to her as kids with a toy ring. Inside the box is also a plane ticket to France. The flight is at 11:45 PM that same evening. Montana and her friends rush to find a cab to get to the airport while William is there to get to France. Sam informs his airline buddies to stall William until Montana gets there. She runs to the gate too late and misses the flight but runs into William. He confesses his love for her and then proposes to her for real. She accepts and they kiss. As Gail and Sam leave the airport, Montana tries to set them up with the same man. They fight for him as the film ends.","summary":"Pathologically single, 30-something, flight attendant, Montana Moore ('Paula Patton') is on a mission to get her overbearing, frequently married, mother (Jenifer Lewis) to stop pressuring her to get married.

{"id":"3124a380647844f910a3df57b30d5333","document":"Lyra Belacqua ( Dakota Blue Richards ) is (ostensibly) an orphan living at Jordan College in the Oxford of an alternate universe. In Lyra's world, every person is accompanied by a daemon, a physical representation of their soul in animal form. Because she is young, Lyra's daemon, Pantalaimon (voice: Freddie Highmore ) -- Pan, for short -- can change his shape to appear as any animal he chooses. He most often appears as an ermine, or at need a moth or a cat.||||| Adults' daemons settle in to one shape and don't change. Lyra overhears an interview between the Master of Jordan College ( Jack Shepherd ) and Fra Pavel ( Simon McBurney ), a representative of the powerful and sinister religious body called the Magisterium. They're discussing an expedition to the far north planned by Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel ( Daniel Craig ); Asriel wants to study a mysterious substance called Dust that seems to enter Lyra's world from parallel universes. Fra Pavel pressures the Master to withhold his support from Lord Asriel's expedition. The Master refuses, so, when left alone in the room, Fra Pavel poisons a decanter of Tokay wine that has been decanted specially for Lord Asriel.||||| Lord Asriel soon arrives (accompanied by his daemon, a snow leopard), and pours himself a glass of the poisoned Tokay, but Lyra emerges from her hiding place to stop him from drinking it: she dashes the glass to the floor where it shatters. Lord Asriel sends her back to eavesdrop on the meeting that is about to begin. The Master and fellows of Jordan College, plus Fra Pavel, convene to hear about Lord Asriel's proposed expedition and research on Dust, which they agree to fund. Asriel is sure that Dust is connected with a means to get from one universe to other parallel universes. Pavel tells Asriel that talk of Dust is heresy. Even before we meet Lyra, boys and girls have been disappearing, snatched off the streets. The children call the kidnappers Gobblers. Lyra and her friend Roger ( Ben Walker ) promise one another that if either is caught, the other will come to the rescue. That night, while Lyra is at dinner being introduced to Mrs. Coulter ( Nicole Kidman ), Roger and another friend, Billy Costa ( Charlie Rowe ), are taken by the Gobblers.||||| At the dinner, Lyra is seated immediately across the table from the Master when Mrs. Coulter arrives, accompanied by her daemon, a golden monkey. The Master and all the scholars are evidently in awe of her. Mrs. Coulter takes a seat right next to Lyra, who is most impressed with her new acquaintance and agrees eagerly when Mrs. Coulter says she is also planning a trip to the far north, and proposes that Lyra come along as her assistant. The Master is evidently forced (by Mrs. Coulter's influence in high places) to agree. In the morning, just before Lyra's departure, the Master comes to Lyra's little upper room in college and gives her a strange golden instrument called an alethiometer, or \"golden compass\". He tells her that it is capable of telling the truth, but he can't tell her much about how it works. He admonishes her to keep the alethiometer to herself and above all not to let Mrs. Coulter know that she has it.||||| Lyra spends some time in Mrs. Coulter's company, going to expensive shops to be bought new clothes and restaurants to dine with posh people. All the while, Lyra keeps the alethiometer with her in a shoulder bag. One day Mrs. Coulter orders her to stop wearing the shoulder bag, and when the girl shows reluctance Mrs. Coulter has her daemon, the golden monkey, half strangle Pantalaimon.||||| Lyra runs to her room, now hating Mrs. Coulter, hides the alethiometer, then goes to explore Mrs. Coulter's private study. In a waste paper bin Pan finds papers which show that Mrs. Coulter is deeply involved with an arm of the Magisterium called the General Oblation Board (the Gobblers!); that the General Oblation Board is using children to investigate something called intercision; and that Billy Costa and Roger the kitchen boy are on a list of boys who have been taken. Immediately after discovering this, Lyra catches Mrs. Coulter's golden monkey daemon trying to steal the alethiometer. Pan changes into a bird, grabs it back, and they flee through the upstairs window. They're pursued and caught by Gobblers, then rescued by fierce but friendly Gyptians, who have been watching over Lyra at Lord Asriel's request. One of their rescuers is Ma Costa ( Clare Higgins ), Billy's mother.||||| Lyra travels with the Gyptians and becomes acquainted with John Faa ( Jim Carter ), lord of the Gyptians, and his advisor Farder Coram ( Tom Courtenay ). She learns how to ask the alethiometer questions and how to interpret its responses. She also meets Serafina Pekkala ( Eva Green ), queen of the witches, who tells Lyra that she is the subject of a prophecy concerning the fate of the world; that the missing children are being held at Bolvangar in Norroway; and that Lyra will find help in Trollesund, a town on the coast of Norroway. Meanwhile, Mrs. Coulter has dispatched a pair of mechanical spy flies to locate Lyra. When the spy flies find the Gyptian ship, Farder Coram captures one and seals it up in a tin, explaining that its sting contains a sleeping potion. The other escapes, though it's not clear that it does Mrs. Coulter any good.||||| When they arrive in Trollesund, Lyra meets the Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby ( Sam Elliot ), who offers to help her -- but first he wants to get a friend out of a jam. The friend is Iorek Byrnison (voice: Ian McKellen ), one of the great Panserbjorne -- armored ice bears -- of Svalbard. Iorek, exiled from his home after losing a fight, is a virtual prisoner in Trollesund; the townspeople got him drunk and stole his armor, which he cherishes the way humans cherish their daemons. Now, alcoholic and despairing, he works as a mechanic and metalsmith in exchange for whiskey. Consulting the alethiometer, Lyra learns that Iorek Byrnison was heir to the throne of Svalbard until he was betrayed and defeated by Ragnar (voice: Habib Nasib Nader ), the current king. She also learns where the armor is hidden and tells Iorek, who promises in return to help her find the missing children. Lee Scoresby and the Gyptians dissuade the soldiers who try to stop the re-armored bear, and Lyra and her allies march into the interior toward Bolvangar.||||| When they camp for the night, Lyra puzzles over something the alethiometer is telling her and seeks out Iorek Byrnison. She asks him to take her to a valley nearby, where she finds Billy Costa, weak and anguished because he's been separated from his daemon. This, Lyra realizes, is what intercision means; it's a fate so horrible she and Pan can hardly bear to think about it. Iorek Byrnison and Lyra take Billy back to the Gyptians' camp, which is immediately set upon by the ferocious Samoyed people who live in that area.||||| They capture Lyra and carry her to Svalbard as an offering to the armored bears. Recalling that Mrs. Coulter told her King Ragnar longs to have a daemon of his own, Lyra asks Pan to hide and introduces herself to Ragnar as Iorek Byrnison's daemon. As she hoped, Ragnar becomes furiously jealous. Lyra tells him that if he can defeat Iorek in single combat, she will become Ragnar's daemon. Ragnar agrees to fight Iorek Byrnison, and Iorek gallops up on cue, intending to rescue Lyra. When Lyra explains what she's arranged, apologetic and frightened because after running all that way Iorek seems in no shape to fight, Iorek surprises her with his enthusiasm. He wants nothing more from life than a chance to fight Ragnar, and dubs her Lyra Silvertongue for her skillful manipulation of the usurper-king.||||| Iorek fights Ragnar and kills him by feigning an injury, then hitting Ragnar so hard his jaw flies off. This victory wins back Iorek Byrnison's rightful place as king of the ice bears, but he leaves his kingdom to complete his obligation to Lyra. He takes her most of the way to the experimental station at Bolvangar where the children are being held, but has to leave her and go for help when the bridge over a crevasse breaks, leaving Iorek on the wrong side. Inside the experimental station, Lyra asks Roger to get the other children ready to escape. He shows her to a room where she can be alone with the alethiometer, but she has to hide under the table when the experimental station staff and Mrs. Coulter come in. After Mrs. Coulter leaves, Lyra's foot slips, giving her away. She's captured by the staff and she and Pan are put into the intercision device, the machine used to separate children from their daemons. The separation is almost complete when Mrs. Coulter, looking terrified, runs in and stops the procedure.||||| Lyra and Pan wake up with their bond intact, and a distraught Mrs. Coulter assures Lyra that she's safe and she'll never be hurt. Lyra, shrinking from Mrs. Coulter, asks why they're separating children from their daemons. Mrs. Coulter explains that Dust (which she seems to equate with original sin) came into the world long ago when people first disobeyed the Authority (God). While children are immune from Dust, it contaminates adults through their daemons. The goal of the intercision research is to prevent people from ever being affected by Dust. (This explanation is a slightly more palatable version of the one given in an earlier scene, in which high officials of the Magisterium, disturbed about Jordan College's rebellious support of Lord Asriel, look forward to a future when intercision will mold a population that never questions the Magisterium's authority.) Mrs. Coulter says that intercision doesn't hurt -- \"it's just a little cut.\"||||| If intercision is such a good thing, Lyra counters, why did Mrs. Coulter stop the lab staff from doing it to Lyra? Mrs. Coulter admits that the procedure isn't perfect yet. When she mentions taking Lyra home, Lyra says venomously that her home is Jordan College. Mrs. Coulter reveals that she is Lyra's mother -- a relationship Lyra rejects -- and that Lord Asriel is her father. Lyra pretends to cooperate when Mrs. Coulter asks for the alethiometer, but gives her instead the tin holding the spy fly. The fly's sting knocks out Mrs Coulter and her daemon.||||| Lyra escapes and leads the children out into the snow, pausing only to sabotage the intercision device, which explodes in a very satisfying way. Outside the experimental station the children confront the guards, who attack them. Iorek Byrnison intervenes, but is nearly overcome before the arrival, at dramatic intervals, of Lee Scoresby, the witches led by Serafina Pekkala, and the Gyptians. There's a ferocious melee; whenever someone is killed, their daemon disintegrates in a swirl of Dust. Lyra's friends win the battle. Lyra sets off with Iorek Byrnison and Lee Scoresby to find Lord Asriel, who has been captured by the Samoyed people. Roger insists on coming along. Meanwhile Mrs. Coulter, having learned that Lord Asriel has bribed his captors and set up a laboratory to continue his research on Dust, sets off to stop him. In the final scene, Lyra and Roger curl up with Iorek Byrnison in the back of Mr. Scoresby's flying machine, heading north.","summary":"It was no ordinary life for a young girl: living among scholars in the hallowed halls of Jordan College and tearing unsupervised through Oxford's motley streets on mad quests for adventure. But Lyra's greatest adventure would begin closer to home, the day she heard hushed talk of an extraordinary particle. Microscopic in size, the magical dust- discovered in the vast Arctic expanse of the North -was rumored to possess profound properties that could unite whole universes. But there were those who feared the particle and would stop at nothing to destroy it. Catapulted into the heart of a terrible struggle, Lyra was forced to seek aid from clans, 'gyptians, and formidable armored bears. And as she journeyed into unbelievable danger, she had not the faintest clue that she alone was destined to win, or to lose, this more-than-mortal battle."}
